Code for the Cedarbrook Middle School Robotics Team.

If you have found this the mentor of the CBK rbotics team has sent you here for code. That is why i made this. I did this for logging programs for robots so we can look back on it if we need help. You will find code from 2023 and beyond here. I will post my updates with ROADRUNNER here as a testing measure. Remember that the school computers cant get to this. Also if i don't get into intro to java with all of this ima be pissed. Anyway thats all. I will give editor level privleges to the new coaches of coding as years pass.
